TITLE: Automated Twitter Manager (AutoTweet)

URL: http://twittermanager.herokuapp.com/

DESCRIPTION: A tool which allows one to input tweets to a database, and then have those tweets be sent out on timed intervals.

VISION STATEMENT: Create a resource for businesses to maintain a Twitter presence without having to have a dedicated social media manager.

MOTIVATION: One of our group members works at a scooter shop, and had the idea to create this bot so said shop could spend less time managing social media while still having a presence.  

RISKS: Using programming language that all group members are not familiar with.
       Time Management will be challenging.
       Our group members have never worked together before.
       Using unfamiliar APIs and Databases.
       Unfamiliarity with APP development (both web and mobile.)


MITIGATION STRATEGIES FOR DEALING WITH THE RISKS:
      Group members with more experience with the programming languages will help the less-experienced members get up to speed.
      We will dedicate specific windows of time that work with all of the members of the team.
      We will democratically make important decisions regarding the project.
      YouTube and other resources should make the learning process fairly quick.
      Impliment features in parts to guarentee workable code at various stages.
